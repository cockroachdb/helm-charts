# watchNamespaces controls which namespaces the operator monitors for CockroachDB clusters.
# Default (empty string) = global mode: operator watches all namespaces cluster-wide.
# Single namespace: "prod" — operator watches only that namespace.
# Multiple namespaces: "prod-a,prod-b,prod-c" — operator watches the comma-separated list.
#
# Note: The operator's own deployment namespace (set via helm -n flag) is independent
# of the namespaces it watches. For example, you can deploy the operator into
# "cockroach-operator-system" while scoping it to watch "prod-a,prod-b" only.
#
# WARNING: Do not configure multiple operator deployments to watch overlapping namespaces
# in production. Both operators will independently reconcile the same clusters, which
# can cause unpredictable behavior, especially across different operator versions.
